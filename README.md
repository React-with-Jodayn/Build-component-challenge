# ðŸ§© Build Component Challenge

This is my first React challenge where I practiced breaking the UI into components using **JavaScript** before switching to **TypeScript** as suggested.

## ðŸš€ What I Built

- A layout that includes:
  - A **header** component (`Header`)
  - A **post** component (`Post`) reused multiple times
  - A **button** component (`Button`) styled with CSS
  - A **button holder** component (`ButtonHolder`) rendering multiple buttons inside a styled `<nav>`

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand the basics of React component structure
- Practice reusability by rendering the same component multiple times
- Apply basic CSS styling to components
- Structure components inside a parent container (`App`)

## ðŸ§© Components Breakdown

### `App.jsx`
- Combines all components and organizes the layout

### `Header.jsx`
- Displays a fixed header with a custom style

### `Post.jsx`
- Represents a single post with title and body

### `Button.jsx`
- A single styled button labeled "Tag Button"

### `ButtonHolder.jsx`
- Contains and displays multiple `Button` components in a flex layout

### `Post.css` / `button.css`
- Custom styles applied to the `Post` and `Button` components

## ðŸ“š Learnings

- The value of breaking UI into components
- How to style and reuse components effectively
- Difference between inline styles and external CSS
- Foundation for switching from JavaScript to TypeScript
